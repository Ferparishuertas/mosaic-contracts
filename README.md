Mosaic is a parallelization schema for decentralized applications.
It composes heterogeneous blockchain systems into one another.
Decentralized applications can use Mosaic to compute over a composed network of multiple blockchain systems in parallel.

Mosaic enables building scalable blockchain token economies through the bidirectional transposition of ERC20 tokens on one blockchain, the *origin* chain, and a utility token representation on another blockchain, the *auxiliary* chain.

The Protocol defines a set of actions that are performed atomically across a gateway. A gateway for a given token is comprised of a `EIP20Gateway` contract on origin, a corresponding `EIP20CoGateway` contract on auxiliary, and and an ERC20 contract on auxiliary that mints and burns utility tokens for an equivalent value of ERC20 tokens staked and unstaked on origin. Atomicity is achieved by combining performance of the transpositional actions in a 2-phase-commit structure with a hash-timelock on each of the origin and auxiliary chains.
